/**
 * Workflow definitions (stages, weights, priority, name) keyed by Prisma `WorkflowType`.
 *
 * Ported from the Vite app's `src/workflows.js` — the "three workflows' metadata" (project-overview
 * §6). There is intentionally **no `Workflow` DB table** (decided 2026-06-15): these values are
 * static, so they live as code and are unit-testable as constants. Pure data — no storage reads (§17).
 *
 * - `FEATURE` — 10-stage roadmap lifecycle.
 * - `TECH_DEBT` / `SUPPORT` / `INTERNAL_BUG` — the shared 4-stage set (§16: internal bugs reuse the
 *   support/techdebt stages); weights differ per type.
 * - `CUSTOM` — no fixed stages; excluded from status→stage seeding.
 *
 * The bootstrap seed (`prisma/seed.mjs`) imports this as the single source for each workflow's stage
 * **count**, to bounds-check `StatusStageMapping.stageIndex`.
